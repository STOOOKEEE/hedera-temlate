              These are live pricing examples. They do not collect a payment,

              testnet invoice flow uses SAUCE until a supported alternative is
              deployed and validated.

          <p>
            SaucerSwap converts HBAR to the requested token. A standalone

          <p>
            The payment contract binds merchant and amount, limits spend and
            returns surplus. Removing the swap breaks HBAR-funded token
            settlement.
