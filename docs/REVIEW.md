# Reviewer walkthrough

[README](../README.md) · [Validation record](VALIDATION.md) · [Official bounty brief](https://hedera.com/blog/scaffold-hbar-template-bounty/)

This is a navigation guide to the implementation and [verified testnet evidence](VALIDATION.md#live-testnet-deployment-and-payment--2026-09-22). The contest submission and organizer eligibility review have not occurred.

For a ready-to-adapt pitch, timed demo and evidence preflight, use [Submission package](SUBMISSION.md).

## 1. Try the integration without setup

Open [the live demo](https://saucerpay-hedera.vercel.app), enter `1` in the quote panel and request SAUCE testnet and USDC mainnet quotes using the quote-asset selector. They read SaucerSwap; no fabricated price is substituted for a failed request. The hosted app is configured with the testnet checkout. Open the [paid invoice](https://saucerpay-hedera.vercel.app/pay/0x8f97d7a7c61394e9f927e2b0d9d7b62fc396d091cfffc0475ab3b13493b58e61?tx=0xd9d3d092b020d8d0e05825f7636f1be6085d3e935a18d2286d4a5448f42a85d1) to inspect a real two-wallet receipt without a wallet.

## 2. Generate and run a clean copy

Follow [Getting started](GETTING_STARTED.md) from an empty parent folder. The supported generator entry point is:

```bash
npx create-scaffold-hbar@latest --template STOOOKEEE/hedera-temlate
```

Then run lint, tests, build, start and smoke as documented. [Validation](VALIDATION.md#fresh-public-scaffold--2026-09-22) records a fresh generator/install/test/build/boot pass for public source commit `57483b8`, which contains the live payment evidence and gas fix.

## 3. Inspect what is reusable

The exact-output conversion and surplus return are implemented in a single payment transaction. Token association and merchant invoice creation happen separately. The [customization recipe](CUSTOMIZATION.md) identifies what remains application-specific.

## 4. Check chain evidence honestly

[Deploy on testnet](DEPLOYMENT.md), then exercise the two-wallet UI flow or optional smoke. The published [HashScan payment](https://hashscan.io/testnet/transaction/0xd9d3d092b020d8d0e05825f7636f1be6085d3e935a18d2286d4a5448f42a85d1) has separate merchant and payer accounts and passes `npm run submission:check`. The automated smoke supports either one or two accounts and labels the evidence accordingly. The injected-wallet UI signing path has not yet been exercised live.

The [validation record](VALIDATION.md#live-testnet-deployment-and-payment--2026-09-22) gives the genuine testnet links, network, contract, token, invoice and observed result. Contract deployment proves deployment; the successful invoice payment demonstrates the conversion and exact token delivery. A quote, screenshot or local mock cannot stand in for either transaction.

Also complete the official submission fields, including the developer-experience survey. This repository did not use Hedera Harness and does not claim a harness specification or harness validators. Consult the current brief for the final submission requirements.
